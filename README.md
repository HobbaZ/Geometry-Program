# Geometry Program
This program asks the user how many geometry math questions they would like, then chooses a random question from a giant if statement (bad practive, but useful for testing), then chooses 2 random numbers for the inputs of each question. 

This program was inspired by a square and rectangle area finder tutorial in a Python textbook I was working through, I had to type a short sentance of code to run the program and type my own integers. I decided that that was too much work and converted the program so the computer chose the integers for me, then I had the amazing idea to expend the area finding to various other shapes as well as implementing length, width finding and formula printing if you got the incorrect answer.

### Known bugs
Surprinsingly none that I know of, just is really long and unoptimised (alot of copy paste from other functions, bad structure, validatators are copied to each function instead of being an individual function, etc). 

### Technology
Python
